RestAuth 0.6.2 (26 May 2013)

  * Rename ContentHandler to RestAuthContentHandler to avoid nameclashes.

RestAuth 0.6.1 (22 April 2013)

  * Convert properties to string before they are sent to the RestAuth server.

	reference implementation.

  * Support for RestAuth 0.6. This includes setting multiple properties.
    and detection for the HTTP 403 Forbidden status code.
  * Use pure libcurl instead of pecl_http, which removes a runtime dependency.
  * Support setting additional headers or any curl option via the constructor.
  * Remove some function parameters that were never used.
  * Use the new services defined in version 0.6.1 of the testserver of the
    RestAuth server reference implementation. 

RestAuth 0.5.0 (23 September 2011)

  * Initial version based on version 0.5 of the RestAuth protocol.
